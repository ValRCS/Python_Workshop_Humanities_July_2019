# Python Dictionaries

Exactly what it sounds like, an unordered collection of key - value pairs

mydict = {"myname" : "Valdis", "likes" : "potatoes", "cleans" : "potatoes"}

* keys must be unique for the dictionary!
* values for different keys can be matching

Idiom for looping(iterating) over them

```python
for key, value in mydict:
    print(f"Key {key} gives value {value}")
```

Note: in Python 3.7 dictionaries are insertion ordered (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39980323/are-dictionaries-ordered-in-python-3-6?rq=1)
